### Project Overview

We present an end-to-end machine learning project that aims to predict the age of different abalone samples starting from weight and length characteristics.

The project is divided into the following steps:

    * Data loading and exploratory data analysis;
    * Data preprocessing and preparation for training;
    * Model training, evaluation, and tuning;
    * Model deployment.

We used the streamlit library to create a data web app where the EDA and model were deployed.
